# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

Your portfolio is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment!

## ✅ Status: Ready for Deployment 

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/malakafaqahmad/my-portfolio2

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
   - The workflow will automatically deploy your site when you push to the main branch

3. **Your portfolio will be available at**: https://malakafaqahmad.github.io/my-portfolio2/

## Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build your project and push it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## What's Configured

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- ✅ Vite configuration with correct base URL for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Build optimization for production
- ✅ TypeScript compilation fixes
- ✅ Asset handling for GitHub Pages

## Making Changes

1. Make your changes locally

3. Commit and push to main branch
4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the updated site

## Troubleshooting

- If the site doesn't appear immediately, wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for deployment status
- Ensure GitHub Pages is set to use "GitHub Actions" as the source
